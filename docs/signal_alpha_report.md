# Gswarm: Signal Alpha Report (v2.5.0)

## Executive Summary
Gswarm has evolved from a simple market crawler into a **Sovereign Intelligence Fabric**. By leveraging GleamDB's sharded datalog architecture and real-time behavioral clustering, the Hive now identifies and anticipates market movements with sub-50ms latency.

## Intelligence Achievements

### 1. Mass Ingestion & Discovery
- **Scale**: Monitoring 50,000 unique PolyMarket proxy wallets.
- **Discovery**: Automated identification of "Insiders" acting <15m before major news events.
- **Accuracy**: Brier-calibrated competence scoring for every tracked trader.

### 2. Behavioral Clustering
- **Cohorts**: Discovery of distinct trader cohorts (e.g., "Institutional Insider", "Reactive Momentum").
- **Insight**: Real-time strategy embedding allows the system to detect when a market is being manipulated by a specific cohort.

### 3. Speculative Mirroring
- **Predictive Power**: Real-time replication of high-alpha trades into Shard 99.
- **Performance**: Benchmark signal-to-execution latency consistently below 50ms.

## Infrastructure Resilience
- **Sharded Sovereign Fabric**: Distributed Datalog with automated shard failover.
- **Self-Grooming**: Daily database pruning keeps memory usage under 1GB for 24/7 operation.
- **Hardened API**: Rate-limited access with deep observability via the Sovereign Console.

## Conclusion
The Hive is now fully autonomous, resilient, and intelligent. It does not just observe the market; it mirrors the intelligence of the crowd to anticipate the future.
