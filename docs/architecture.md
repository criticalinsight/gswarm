# Gswarm Architecture 🧙🏾‍♂️🐝

Gswarm is designed using the **Rama Pattern** (Write-Optimized Transactional Store + Read-Optimized Indices). It leverages GleamDB's unique ability to de-complect time, logic, and context.

## 🧱 Component Topology

### 1. Sharded Transactor Nodes (`gswarm/node.gleam`)
The fabric is horizontally partitioned into **Logical Shards**. A `ShardedContext` coordinates multiple `gleamdb` instances across parallel OS processes. The `Lean` role collapses shards for resource-efficient local simulation.

### 2. Elastic Ingestion & Insider Detection (`gswarm/ingest_batcher.gleam`)
High-throughput ingestion ingest trade activity and immediately computes **Lead-Time Lag** against price inflection points. Insiders are flagged and persisted to the `InsiderStore`.

### 3. Micro-Execution Engine (`gswarm/copytrader.gleam`)
A specialized execution actor that mirrors "Verified Insider" trades with strict slippage and capital controls ($10 max/trade). It ensures execution stability even in thin markets.

### 4. Raft Consensus & Failover (`gswarm/fabric.gleam`)
Nodes maintain cluster state via a `role_watcher_loop`. If a Leader steps down or fails, the fabric autonomously detects the new Raft leader state and performs **Autohealing**: restarting market tickers and watchers from the durable Mnesia store.

### 4. Probabilistic Intelligence (`gswarm/hll.gleam`, `gswarm/cms.gleam`)
The system maintains O(1) space approximations of:
- **Cardinality**: HyperLogLog for unique market tracking across billions of events.
- **Frequency**: Count-Min Sketch for identifying "hot" market signals in real-time.

### 5. Graph Intelligence Hub (`gswarm/graph_intel.gleam`)
A periodic analytical battery that leverages GleamDB v2.0.0 features:
- **Sovereign Intelligence**: Distributed aggregation (`q.avg`) for cross-market statistics.
- **Navigator**: Query planner visibility (`explain`) for optimizing intelligence scans.
- **Graph Suite**: Cycle detection for wash-trading, SCC for community identification, and PageRank for influence scoring.
- **Speculative Soul**: `with_facts` for "What-if" trade simulation without side effects.

## 🛡️ Stability & Resilience
- **Resource Awareness**: Lean mode targets the Apple Silicon M2 Pro's efficiency cores.
- **Durable WAL**: Mnesia ensures facts survive process restarts.
- **Active Paging**: `pruner.gleam` maintains a sliding window of historical state to bound RAM usage.
- **Configurable Parallelism**: GleamDB's `Config(parallel_threshold, batch_size)` allows tuning query concurrency per workload — critical for matching parallelism to M2 core topology.
