# GleamCMS Themes 🧙🏾‍♂️

This directory is reserved for future theme packages.

Currently, the default theme is implemented functionally in `src/gleamdb/gleamcms/builder/theme.gleam`.

## Roadmap
In future versions (Phase 6+), this folder will contain subdirectories for individual themes:

- `themes/dark-glass/`
- `themes/paper-white/`
- `themes/matrix-terminal/`

Each theme will provide its own `layout.html` template and `style.css`.
