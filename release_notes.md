## [2.1.0] - 2026-02-18
### Added
- **GleamCMS Foundation**: Integrated Wisp-based admin server and Lustre-based interactive editor.
- **Fact-Sync Bridge**: Decentralized API for pushing atomic Datalog facts directly to the CMS store.
- **Robustness Hardening**: 
    - **Schema Guards**: Enforce slug and metadata integrity before transactions.
    - **Atomic Persistence**: Multi-fact updates are now wrapped in atomic GleamDB transactions.
    - **Admin Authentication**: Token-based middleware protection for administrative routes.
- **Exhaustive Projections**: Refactored SSG generator to use sum types (`PostStatus`), providing compile-time guarantees for content state handling.
- **Legacy Import Bridge**: Robust JSON ingestion for legacy Publii data using `gleam/dynamic/decode`.

- **Consolidated Sovereignty**: Reconciled vendored engine code into a single source of truth.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-02-16
### Added
- **Distributed Aggregates**: Compute complex analytics across shards in parallel.
- **Parallel Query Execution**: Solver now utilizes multi-threading for fragmented queries.
- **Datalog Optimization**: Optimized variable binding in deeply nested clauses.

## [1.7.1] - 2026-02-14
### Documentation
- Updated `README.md` with Sharding examples.
- Completed Phase 25 in `roadmap_vnext.md` & `gap_analysis.md`.
- Added `performance_guide.md` benchmarks for native sharding.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-02-14
### Added
- **Native Sharding**: Horizontal partitioning of facts across strictly isolated local shards (`gleamdb/sharded`).
    - **Consistent Hashing**: `bloom.shard_key` deterministic routing.
    - **Local-First Leadership**: Each shard manages its own Raft term and log.
    - **Multi-Core Saturation**: Linear scaling with logical cores on M2/M3 silicon.
- **Democratic Partitioning**: Shards are treated as autonomous "City States" that vote on cluster topology.
- **Deterministic Identity**: `fact.deterministic_uid` and `fact.phash2` ensure ID consistency across distributed nodes without coordination.
- **Batch Ingestion**: `sharded.batch_ingest` for high-throughput writes (10k+ ops/sec/node).

### Changed
- **Architecture**: Moved closer to a "Shared Nothing" architecture for maximum parallel throughput.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-02-13
### Added
- **Sharded Sovereign Fabric**: Full sharding support with local-first leadership.
- **Adaptive Ticking**: Dynamic ingestion batching based on load.
- **Bloom Filter Routing**: Optimized query pruning across shards.
- **Probabilistic Memory**: Count-Min Sketch (frequency) and HyperLogLog (cardinality) for lean monitoring.
- **Resource-Aware Node**: Lean mode for restricted environments (M2 Pro 16GB).

### Changed
- Reverted to `list.range` for arity-stability across compiler versions.
- Optimized `registry_actor` for synchronized shard tracking.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-09

This release introduces **Phase 23: Time Series & Analytics**, transforming GleamDB from a purely logical engine into a high-performance analytical store for time-series data.

## ✨ Key Features

### ⏳ Time Series Primitives
- **`Temporal` Clause**: Native support for time-range queries on integer timestamps.
- **`OrderBy` / `Limit` / `Offset`**: Push-down predicates allow efficient pagination and sorting at the database level.
- **`Aggregate`**: Compute `Avg`, `Sum`, `Count`, `Min`, `Max` directly in the query engine.

### 🆔 Deterministic Identity
- **`phash2` Integration**: Standardized on Erlang's portable hash for generating deterministic Entity IDs from unique keys (e.g., Market IDs).
- Solves indexing consistency issues in distributed setups.

## 📦 Install
```toml
gleamdb = "1.6.0"
```

# 🚀 Resilient Maturity v1.5.0

This release marks the completion of the "Sovereign Transition" roadmap. GleamDB is now a robust, distributed, and AI-native Datalog engine.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🆔 ID Sovereignty (Phase 21)
- De-complected identity from data at the type level using `fact.Ref(EntityId)`.
- Eliminates class of bugs where integers were mistaken for IDs.
- Permeates the entire engine: solver, pull API, and transactor.

### 🗳️ Raft Consensus (Phase 22)
- **Zero-Downtime Failover**: Pure Raft state machine (`raft.gleam`) manages leader election.
- **Split-Brain Protection**: Term-based voting and majority quorums.
- **Autonomous Recovery**: Followers automatically promote themselves if the leader fails.

### 🧭 NSW Vector Index (Phase 23)
- **O(log N) Similarity**: Replaced O(N) brute-force scan with a Navigable Small-World graph.
- **Auto-Indexing**: `Vec` values are automatically indexed on assert/retract.
- **Graph-Accelerated**: `solve_similarity` uses the graph index for unbound variable searches.
- **Enriched Vectors**: Added `euclidean_distance`, `normalize`, and `dimensions` to `vector.gleam`.

## 📚 Documentation
- Updated `distributed_guide.md` with Raft protocols.
- Updated `performance_guide.md` with NSW benchmarks.
- Closed all gaps in `gap_analysis.md`.

## 📦 Install
```toml
gleamdb = "1.5.0"
```

*Built with ❤️ on the BEAM.*
